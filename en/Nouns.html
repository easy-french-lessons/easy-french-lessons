	<div class="title">Nouns and articles - Les noms et les articles</div>

	<p>There are two types of nouns in French :</p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-style: italic;">Common nouns</span> (les noms communs). Most of the time, they are preceded by an article.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-style: italic;">Proper nouns</span> (les noms propres), starting with an uppercase.
	</p>
	
	<h1>Common nouns</h1>

	<h3>Grammatical gender</h3>
	
	<div>
		Some languages feature grammatical genders. French is one of them, and nouns in french can either be feminine or masculine. Knowing the gender of a noun is important, because a lot of words in the sentence that relate to that noun change depending on it's gender. There is no magic/logic here, you have to learn the gender with the noun.
	</div>
	
	<h3>Plural form</h3>
	
	<div class="block">
		<p>Nouns also have a plural form ! </p>
		
		<p>But it's relatively easy to determine the plural form of a noun. Let's take a word we've seen in the previous lesson : un chien. How to get the plural form of this word ? Simply add an S at the end of the word : des chien<span style="font-weight: bold";>s</span>. As you noticed, the article before the noun has changed, we'll talk about this soon. Most of the time, that's how to make the plural form of nouns.</p>
		<p>The S in chiens is completely silent, the pronounciation of the singular and plural form are exactly the same.</p>
	</div>
	<br>

	<div class="block">
		Let's take another word : Â« <div class="tooltip">un jeu
			<div class="tooltiptext">n.m. Game</div>
		</div> Â». The plural form is Â« des jeux Â». We added an X here instead of the S, because the noun ends with -eu. The same rule apply to nouns ending with -au, and -eau (you'll find a litte table at the end which sums things up, don't worry).
	</div>
	<br>

	<div>
		What about nouns ending with -al ? Well, for a lot of them, you replace the -al by -aux :
		<div class="example">
			<div>Un chev<span style="font-weight: bold;">al</span> => des chev<span style="font-weight: bold;">aux</span></div>
			<div>Un anim<span style="font-weight: bold;">al</span> => des anim<span style="font-weight: bold;">aux</span></div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="block">
		Now, what about nouns which singular form ends up with an -s, -x, or -z ? Good news : their singular and plural form are exactly the same ðŸ˜„.
		<div class="example">
			<div>Un poids => des poids</div>
			<div>Un choix => des choix</div>
			<div>Un nez => des nez</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="spacer"></div>
	<div>There are irregularities in all the categories, but we'll just keep it simple for now, we'll come back to this in a later chapter. Here is a sum up of what we've seen so far :</div>
	<br>
	<table class="table_default">
		
		<tr>
			<td>Ending</td>
			<td>The vast majority of the words</td>
			<td>-eu, -au, -eau</td>
			<td>-al</td>
			<td>-ail</td>
			<td>-s, -x, -z</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>What to do</td>
			<td>Append an S</td>
			<td>Append an X</td>
			<td>Replace -al with -aux for most of them</td>
			<td>Sometimes replace -al with -aux<br>Sometimes add an S</td>
			<td>Nothing to change</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Examples</td>
			<td>
				Un frÃ¨re, des frÃ¨res<br>
				Un chat, des chats<br>
				Un ami, des amis
			</td>
			<td>
				Un feu, des feux<br>
				Un Ã©tau, des Ã©taux<br>
				Un bateau, des bateaux
			</td>
			<td>
				Un cheval, des chevaux<br>
				Un mal, des maux<br>
			</td>
			<td>
				Un travail, des travaux<br>
				Un dÃ©tail, des dÃ©tails

			</td>

	<h1>Proper nouns</h1>
	<div>
		Proper nouns are user for first/last names, cities, countries, brands... They always start with an uppercase. They also have a grammatical gender. It's easy for first names : the gender is the one of who it refers to : Philippe is masculine, Caroline is feminine. For cities, countries... you can't guess it : Japon is masculine, France is feminine.
	</div>

	<h1>Articles - Les articles</h1>

	<div>
		Now that we have a bit of knowledge on nouns, we can talk about articles ðŸ™‚. Most of the time, nouns will be preceeded by an article.
	</div>
	<div>
		There are two main types of articles : definite (dÃ©fini), indefinite (indÃ©fini). While the explanation about which one to choose is very simple, it seems that knowing the right one to use for French learners is not that easy.
	</div>
	<h3>Definite articles</h3>
	<p>
		This is the one you use when the noun the article qualifies is definite : the noun <span style="font-weight: bold;">refers to something that's know in the context</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Say you're sitting at the restaurant with Marie. You're talking about the piece of bread that lies just in front of you on the table, and Marie knows you're talking about this specific piece of bread : the context clearly defines which piece of bread you're talking about, so in your sentence, when talking about bread, you would use a definite article.
	</p>
	<p>Now, remember that nouns can be either masculine, feminine, or plural. So we have 3 definite articles, one for each case !</p>
	<div class="centered_div">
		<table class="table_default">
			<tr>
				<td>Singular, masculine</td>
				<td>Singular, feminine</td>
				<td>Plural</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>le</td>
				<td>la</td>
				<td>les</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</div>
	<p>Bread in French is Â« pain Â», so talking about it with Marie you'd say Â« le pain Â».</p>

	<h3>Indefinite articles</h3>
	<p>On the contrary, when the context doesn't tell you which object you're talking about, you can't use a definite article, you have to use an indefinite article instead.</p>
	<div class="example">
		<div>
			Un chien <div class="tooltip">mange
			<div class="tooltiptext">v. manger, to eat</div></div> une <div class="tooltip">souris
			<div class="tooltiptext">n.f. mouse</div></div>.<span style="font-style: italic;"> A dog eats a mouse.</span>
		</div>
		
		<div>In this sentence, the context tells you neither which dog we are talking about, nor which mouse we're talking about.</div>
		<br>
		<div>Le chien mange une souris.</div>
		<div>Now, <span style="font-style: italic;">Le</span> chien, means that with the context, we know which dog is eating the mouse, for example if we were talking about Marie's neighbour's dog just before.</div>
	</div>
	<div>As for definite articles, there are 3 indefinite articles.</div>
	<div class="centered_div">
		<table class="table_default">
			<tr>
				<td>Singular, masculine</td>
				<td>Singular, feminine</td>
				<td>Plural</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>un</td>
				<td>une</td>
				<td>des</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</div>
