	<div class="title">Nouns and articles - Les noms et les articles</div>

	<p>There are two types of nouns in French :</p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-style: italic;">Common nouns</span> (les noms communs). Most of the time, they are preceded by an article.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-style: italic;">Proper nouns</span> (les noms propres), starting with an uppercase.
	</p>
	
	<h1>Common nouns</h1>

	<h3>Grammatical gender</h3>
	
	<div>
		Some languages feature grammatical genders. French is one of them, and nouns in french can either be feminine or masculine. Knowing the gender of a noun is important, because a lot of words in the sentence that relate to that noun change depending on it's gender. There is no magic/logic here, you have to learn the gender with the noun.
	</div>
	
	<h3>Plural form</h3>
	
	<div class="block">
		<p>Nouns also have a plural form ! </p>
		
		<p>But it's relatively easy to determine the plural form of a noun. Let's take a word we've seen in the previous lesson : un chien. How to get the plural form of this word ? Simply add an S at the end of the word : des chien<span style="font-weight: bold";>s</span>. As you noticed, the article before the noun has changed, we'll talk about this soon. Most of the time, that's how to make the plural form of nouns.</p>
		<p>The S in chiens is completely silent, the pronounciation of the singular and plural form are exactly the same.</p>
	</div>
	<br>

	<div class="block">
		Let's take another word : Â« <div class="tooltip">un jeu
			<div class="tooltiptext">n.m. Game</div>
		</div> Â». The plural form is Â« des jeux Â». We added an X here instead of the S, because the noun ends with -eu. The same rule apply to nouns ending with -au, and -eau (you'll find a litte table at the end which sums things up, don't worry).
	</div>
	<br>

	<div>
		What about nouns ending with -al ? Well, for a lot of them, you replace the -al by -aux :
		<div class="example">
			<div>Un chev<span style="font-weight: bold;">al</span> => des chev<span style="font-weight: bold;">aux</span></div>
			<div>Un anim<span style="font-weight: bold;">al</span> => des anim<span style="font-weight: bold;">aux</span></div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="block">
		Now, what about nouns which singular form ends up with an -s, -x, or -z ? Good news : their singular and plural form are exactly the same ðŸ˜„.
		<div class="example">
			<div>Un poids => des poids</div>
			<div>Un choix => des choix</div>
			<div>Un nez => des nez</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="spacer"></div>
	<div>There are irregularities in all the categories, but we'll just keep it simple for now, we'll come back to this in a later chapter. Here is a sum up of what we've seen so far :</div>
	<br>
	<table class="table_default">
		
		<tr>
			<td>Ending</td>
			<td>The vast majority of the words</td>
			<td>-eu, -au, -eau</td>
			<td>-al</td>
			<td>-ail</td>
			<td>-s, -x, -z</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>What to do</td>
			<td>Append an S</td>
			<td>Append an X</td>
			<td>Replace -al with -aux for most of them</td>
			<td>Sometimes replace -al with -aux<br>Sometimes add an S</td>
			<td>Nothing to change</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Examples</td>
			<td>
				Un frÃ¨re, des frÃ¨res<br>
				Un chat, des chats<br>
				Un ami, des amis
			</td>
			<td>
				Un feu, des feux<br>
				Un Ã©tau, des Ã©taux<br>
				Un bateau, des bateaux
			</td>
		</tr>
