	<h1>A word of introduction</h1>

	<p>Hello ! I'm Philippe. Welcome here, I tried to write a collection of French lessons that I hope will be easy to follow.</p>
	<p>First and foremost : <span style="font-weight: bold">I'm not a French teacher, and English is not my mother tongue !</span></p>
	<p>I tried to find some websites to help someone who wanted to learn French, but I didn't really find anything easy, structured, and free. I'll try writing something simple and clear, that you can follow article by article, or in which you can find help on a specific topic.</p>
	<p>I'll try to include as much examples as possible, and to give you some exercises and vocabulary at the end of the lessons. I'll also try to provide you with some texts, because finding texts that are readable at a specific level is not that easy.</p>

	<p>I won't cover pronounciation (for now at least), as there are videos on YouTube that are probably much better than what I could do.</p>
	
	<p>As I said, I'm no native English speaker, my English is far from perfect. If you want to help me improve the text, feel free to contact me üôÇ. Same if you want to translate the website from English to another language.</p>

	<h2>Notes </h2>
	<div>Hover your mouse over words that are <div class="tooltip">dashed-underlined<div class="tooltiptext">like this :)</div>
	</div> : it'll let you know the meaning in english, the nature of the word, and other details if needed (like the plural form of nouns if irregular).</div>
	<ul>
		<li>n. = noun. A grammatical gender will follow the n. : f for feminie, m for masculine.</li>
		<li>adj. = adjective</li>
		<li>adv. = adverb</li>
		<li>v. = verb</li>
	</ul>
